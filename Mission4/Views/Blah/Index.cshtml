<p>this is me kayaking!</p>

<p>I hope to get a lot of things out of this IS413 class, including but not limited to: how to code, what is ASP.NET, who let the Dawgs out, what is the meaning of life? So far its going ight to be totally honest. I think that the meanig of life questons is answered a lot in differnt peices as we cover and the professor share different spritual thoughts. i think I am learning what ASP.Net is as well. My coding ability tho.. I am workig on it and it is coming sowly but surely. </p>
